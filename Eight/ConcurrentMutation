Consider a sequence of concurrent tasks, each updating a shared
counter.
int matches = 0;
for (Path p : files)
 new Thread(() -> { if (p has some property) matches++; }).start();
 // Illegal to mutate matches. Why is this non atomic

The mutation of the shared counter matches in this scenario is not atomic due to the following reasons:

1. Lack of Atomicity in matches++
The operation matches++ is not a single atomic instruction. It can be broken down into three steps:

Read: Read the current value of matches.
Increment: Add 1 to the value.
Write: Write the new value back to matches.
In a multithreaded context, multiple threads can perform these steps concurrently, leading to race conditions. For example:

Thread A reads matches as 5.
Thread B reads matches as 5.
Both threads increment their local value to 6.
Both threads write 6 back to matches.
The correct result (7) is lost, and matches ends up being incremented only once instead of twice.

2. No Synchronization Mechanism
In your code, there is no mechanism (like synchronized blocks, locks, or atomic operations) to ensure that the steps of matches++ happen in a mutually exclusive manner. Without synchronization, threads can interleave in arbitrary ways, leading to inconsistent updates to matches.

3. Visibility Issues
Without proper synchronization, threads may not see the latest value of matches due to the Java Memory Model (JMM). Each thread could work with a cached value of matches, and updates might not be propagated to the main memory immediately.

Making matches Update Atomic
To fix this issue, you can use one of the following approaches:

1. Use AtomicInteger
The AtomicInteger class provides atomic operations for integers.

java
Copy code
AtomicInteger matches = new AtomicInteger(0);
for (Path p : files) {
    new Thread(() -> {
        if (/* p has some property */) matches.incrementAndGet();
    }).start();
}
2. Use synchronized
Synchronize the update to matches.

java
Copy code
int matches = 0;
Object lock = new Object();
for (Path p : files) {
    new Thread(() -> {
        if (/* p has some property */) {
            synchronized (lock) {
                matches++;
            }
        }
    }).start();
}
3. Use a Parallel Stream (Recommended for Simpler Code)
Use Java streams to parallelize the task and handle the counting in a thread-safe manner.

java
Copy code
long matches = files.parallelStream()
                    .filter(p -> /* p has some property */)
                    .count();
The first two approaches ensure atomic updates but require careful handling of concurrency. The third approach leverages Java's built-in parallelism and is often the simplest and most maintainable solution.
